Business Problem:

Predicting Delivery Duration for Better Customer Experience
DoorDash aims to provide accurate estimated delivery times to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Incorrect delivery time predictions can lead to negative customer experiences, reduced customer retention, and increased costs due to inefficiencies in order fulfillment.

Problem Formulation(Machine Learning Problem):

This is a supervised regression problem where the goal is to predict a continuous target variableâ€”the total delivery duration (in seconds). 
 y = actual_delivery_time - created_at
 where:
Input Features (X): Includes store details, order characteristics, market conditions, and model-generated estimates.
Target Variable (y): Total delivery duration in seconds.
Machine learning model should be trained on historical delivery data to identify patterns and predict the time required for future deliveries.
